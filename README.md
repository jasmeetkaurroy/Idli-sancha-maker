# Idli-sancha-maker
Idli Sancha Maker is a console-based Java app that calculates tray and rack size compatibility for commercial idli making. It validates tray size, calculates volume of deeps, trays, and racks, and estimates required masala based on nut oil density. Built as part of an internship project.

Project: Idli Sancha Maker
Type: Console-based Java application

Purpose: Helps design customized commercial idli trays and tray racks

Use Case: Calculates tray compatibility, masala (batter) requirement, and volume

🔧 Key Features
Supports three standard tray rack sizes:

Small: 18 inches

Medium: 24 inches

Large: 36 inches

Tray Validation:

Tray must match one of the three sizes, otherwise marked as invalid

Deep (mold) capacity per tray:

Small (18"): 4 to 6 deeps

Medium (24"): 8 to 10 deeps

Large (36"): exactly 16 deeps

Calculations performed:

Volume of one deep

Volume of one tray

Volume of entire tray rack

Masala and water required (based on nut oil density)

💻 Technology Used
Core Java

No external libraries or GUI

Console-based input/output system
